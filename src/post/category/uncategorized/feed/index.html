										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the information age, data has become a crucial resource for companies. More and more people are coming to internet and on multiple devices making comprehensive and accurate user profiles. Apps, online services, websites and tools, social media platforms and they all use private user information to verify, authenticate, and in some cases, store that data.</p>
<p>The public is recognizing that they have less and less control over their own data and the way it is used. Some companies even capitalize on selling this information to third parties.</p>
<p>App developers need to be on the watch for changes in privacy policy laws that regulate the requisition, use, and storage of user information in order to pass the requirements proposed by app stores, avoid being sued and fined, and most importantly, respect the rights of their users.</p>
<p>The Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA is very important to know and abide by if your website or app is designed for kids under the age of 13.</p>
<p>We are going to give a short explanation of this act and then we are going to dive into the particularities that make up this act and the practical steps you can take to ensure you are COPPA compliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is COPPA?</h2>
<p>COPPA is designed to protect the privacy of children in the online environment, as well as in the mobile sphere. This act puts the control of this information in the hands of parents and is effective since July 2013. The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) is responsible for issuing and enforcing this act.</p>
<p>The Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act was enacted all the way back in 1998 by Congress. Its goal is to protect children under 13 within the dynamic online environment and put control over private user information of users under 13 in the hands of their parents.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>When do I need to comply with COPPA?</h2>
<p>The quick answer is that, if you operate on the web (including mobile applications), and your actions include collecting private information of a child that is younger than 13, you fall under the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>It is important to understand what is considered personal information under COPPA so as to avoid unnecessary worries. It basically includes any and all information that can be used to identify a specific user under the age of 13. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The users&#8217; first and last names.</li>
<li>Collecting any information that is related to the users&#8217; place of residence including but not limited to their address, street name, city/town.</li>
<li>Any kind of online information.</li>
<li>Public user or screen name that can be used to contact the user.</li>
<li>Telephone number or any other information that can be used to contact the user via telephone.</li>
<li>Social Security Number.</li>
<li>Any type of information that can be used to track the user across multiple websites and online services.</li>
<li>Any kind of multimedia file containing the user&#8217;s aspiration including photographs, audio files, videos, etc.</li>
<li>Geolocation sufficient to pinpoint any information about the place of residence.</li>
<li>Any information collected online about the parents or the child, which can be combined with the identifiers above to gain further information.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your service, app or websites collects any identifiers cited above, you definitely fall under COPPA. Even if your information gathering is done through voluntary methods and you don&#8217;t requisition it as mandatory, you still fall under this act.</p>
<p>This act doesn&#8217;t require operators to screen their users through age checks, but if they find that a child is using their services, COPPA is automatically triggered and they need to follow procedure. Furthermore, if you are using third-party data (like that of marketing networks) you also fall under COPPA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="does-coppa-apply-to-mobile-apps">Does COPPA apply to mobile apps?</h2>
<p>This act applies to mobile applications that use private information of children younger than 13. It applies to mobile apps regardless of the fact that they are targeting children inside or outside the US. It also targets foreign operators that are a part of US commerce and target kids in the USA.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How to comply with COPPA?</h2>
<p>We are going to discuss the concrete steps you can take to ensure that you are COPPA compliant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a<span> </span><a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/blog/sample-privacy-policy-template">privacy policy</a><span> </span>that is always available and post it in a visible location.</li>
<li>Notify the parents before you start collecting data.</li>
<li>Make it clear that their consent is required to start collecting data and confirm that it will serve the purpose of internal use and notify them about any third-party&#8217;s included in the service provided that will have access to that data.</li>
<li>Allow parents to review the private data that you intend to collect.</li>
<li>Allow parents to discontinue the acquisition of private information at any time.</li>
<li>Ensure the safety and privacy of the data collected, including cases where it is shared with a third-party collaborator.</li>
<li>Limit the storage of the collected data only to a time when you need it to provide a service and ensure that it&#8217;s safe during that time and that it is destroyed after.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-comply-with-coppa-1-online-privacy-policy">1. Online privacy policy</h3>
<p>Within your privacy policy, you will have to explain clearly how you collect, store, and use user information. You need to include information about any third parties that you collaborate with, who also have access to this information or if you take information from them.</p>
<p>The important distinction between a regular online privacy policy and a privacy policy that covers COPPA is the inclusion of parental rights. The aspects that you need to cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assurance that you will not require more information from the child than is absolutely necessary to use the service or participate in an activity.</li>
<li>Informing the parents about their right to review the information, instruct you to delete it, and/or refuse access to any further information.</li>
<li>That they have the right to agree to the use of their child&#8217;s data without it being shared with third parties.</li>
<li>Educate them about the procedures they have at their disposal in order to take action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy needs to be displayed in a visible place and also needs to be always available for review.</p>
<h3 id="1-online-privacy-policy-2-parental-notification">2. Parental notification</h3>
<p>It is mandatory that you notify the parents before you start to gather and use any private information. There are specific things that your notification needs to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that you have collected their contact information for the sole purpose of<span> </span><a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/cookie-consent-banner-generator">prompting them for consent</a><span> </span>and that, in case of their refusal, you will remove this information from your database.</li>
<li>Inform them that you intend to collect and use information about their child.</li>
<li>That their consent is mandatory before you start collecting this data.</li>
<li>Explain the process for them to give their consent if they opt to do that.</li>
<li>Access to your privacy policy.</li>
<li>Explain what data will be collected and who will have access to that data.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img loading="lazy" data-image="105" width="1170" height="573" alt="Parent Educating Child on Computer" title="Parent Educating Child on Computer" src="https://i2.wp.com/greedygame.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HacgMvDZxmHUDpdEAmPd.jpg?resize=1170%2C573&#038;ssl=1" class="lazyload loaded" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<p>There are more than a few ways you can accept this consent:</p>
<ul>
<li>A signed consent can be delivered to you via electronic scan, mail, or fax.</li>
<li>A free of charge call center with a trained support team.</li>
<li>A video conference with support staff.</li>
<li>Use of online payment methods that notify the owner about each separate transaction.</li>
<li>A copy of a government-issued ID card with the assurance that personal data will be destroyed after the verification process is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the data for internal purposes, you can use the &#8220;email plus&#8221; method, but you need to make it clear that the parent or parents can revoke their consent at any point in time.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 id="apple-store-and-coppa">Apple Store and COPPA</h2>
<p>The<span> </span><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.appstore.com/" target="_blank">Apple Store</a><span> </span>has changed its guidelines to require app developers to provide privacy guidelines if they are targeting children that are less than 13 years old. These are the important changes to the guidelines that are connected to COPPA.</p>
<ol>
<li>Behavioral advertising is forbidden in cases where the app is intended for kids that are younger than 13. Contextual ads need to be appropriate for kids.</li>
<li>Before the user links out of the app or uses it for commerce, the app owner needs to get parental permission or use a parental gate.</li>
<li>Apps in the kids&#8217; category need to be targeting kids in the three prescribed age groups:<br />
a. 0 &#8211; 5<br />
b. 6 &#8211; 8<br />
c. 9 &#8211; 11</li>
</ol>
<h2></h2>
<h2 id="google-play-store-and-coppa">Google Play Store and COPPA</h2>
<p>The Designed for Families section in the<span> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://play.google.com/">Google Play Store</a><span> </span>store also requires developers to comply with COPPA in cases where they are targeting kids under the age of 13. This goes for apps that are specifically intended for children as well as apps intended for all ages and may have users that are less than 13 years old.</p>
<h4>Google Mobile ads</h4>
<p>In case you are using google mobile apps in your app, you will need to indicate that the app is intended for an audience younger than 13. This is done so that Google can modify the type of ads they are dishing out and make them age-appropriate.</p>
<h4>The sign in</h4>
<p>If your app is directed at children under the age of 13, you will not be allowed to use Google sign-in or the Google Play Game service. The same thing applies if your app is intended for mixed audiences.</p>
<h4>Speech API</h4>
<p>The android speech API is not to be used in situations where kids are the potential users of the app in question, unless the app is designed to participate in the Designed for Family program.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 id="fines-for-not-complying-with-coppa">Fines for not complying with COPPA</h2>
<p>Fines for not complying with COPPA can range from $16,000 to $40,000 per individual violation. This means that the more users&#8217; information you manage, the larger your fine will be. The COPPA is so present that it was even featured in an episode of Silicon Valley, a popular TV show.</p>
<p>There are more than a few cases of companies being fined for not complying with COPPA. Yelp was fined with a $300,000 fine for not properly screening their users before they allowed them to login to their apps. They were also charged with not properly testing if kids could make accounts using their apps.</p>
<p>Playdom Inc received the largest fine for collecting and discussing minor personal information on its website. Their fine was 3 million US dollars and, while this may seem like a large fine, it doesn&#8217;t really add up to the proposed fines that are supposed to be cumulative.</p>
<p>In Playdom&#8217;s case, the estimated number of children that registered to their site was somewhere around 800,000. If we multiply this number with the lowest possible fine per individual violation, $16,000, we get a final number that is a lot higher than 3 million.</p>
<p>CoppaNow, a website that follows COPPA related cases, has so far calculated that the average fine per individual violation is closer to $2.28 than the minimum $16,000.</p>
<p>Still, even if this is true, the numbers can stack up and you may end up with more fines than your company can pay. This is especially true for small developer companies who are not yet financially capable to handle being fined and dragged to court.</p>
<p>Incarceration is also a possibility in some cases of gross misconduct, so be careful when deciding if you have done everything in your power to become COPPA compliant. Double-check with a legal advisor and avoid relying on half-truths and potential disinformation.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>There is a growing concern about how the FTC is handling the enforcement and fining of COPPA violators, but regardless of this, you can still get fined for not complying with it and some publishing platforms may ban your app or your profile all together for not complying with this act.</p>
<p>Even though the FTC isn&#8217;t really being tenacious about the enforcement of this act, you can&#8217;t really say that it is completely ignored.</p>
<p>Furthermore, being COPPA compliant gives parents a clear green light that they can allow their children to use the app and/or website. This is a big edge if your business model is built around targeting kids as your primary users.</p>
<p>So be sure to have a valid<span> </span><a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/privacy-policy-generator">privacy policy</a><span> </span>and<span> </span><a href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/terms-and-conditions-generator">terms and conditions</a><span> </span>available on your website or mobile app to avoid all these complications and comply with the law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody is discussing about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe&#8217;s new privacy law. As an app publisher, it is crucial for you to know whether you are GDPR compliant or not. In this article, we will understand what exactly is GDPR, how to check if you come under its purview and how to make sure if you are GDPR compliant.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>GDPR Overview</h2>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/greedygame.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gdpr.jpg?w=1170&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
<p id="0a65" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Adopted on April 27th, 2016 by the European Union(EU),<span> </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN" class="fc cf hp hq hr hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">General Data Protection Regulation</a><span> </span>is a data protection and privacy-centric law that became enforceable from May 25th, 2018. The law aims to protect the European citizens&#8217; privacy and offer them complete control of their personal information.</p>
<p id="e73b" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">The recent Cambridge Analytica-Facebook incident has brought more spotlight to GDPR and makes it an important milestone in protecting user privacy. The law holds controllers accountable for misuse of user data and has outlined punitive fines in<span> </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN#d1e6226-1-1" class="fc cf hp hq hr hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Article 83</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Implication of GDPR?</h2>
<p id="e44b" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">GDPR objectifies giving people more control over their personal information that they share online. To make this possible, the law has laid down four basic aspects that any app developer, data processor or website must respect. These aspects aim to provide:</p>
<ol>
<li id="69e3" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Easy access to personal data:</strong><span> </span>Every user is entitled to know how their data is processed in a clear and understandable way.</li>
<li id="99d1" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Right to data portability:<span> </span></strong>Users should be empowered to transfer their personal information from one service provider to another easily.</li>
<li id="4165" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Right to be forgotten:</strong><span> </span>Users should have an option to delete their data by intimating their service provider through simple steps. Once a user exercises the right, their info should be permanently deleted from the service provider’s database.</li>
<li id="43a4" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Right to be informed on data breach:<span> </span></strong>Users must be informed about personal data breach when their data is hacked. The app publisher must notify national supervisory authorities within 72 hours of identification of a data breach.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to prepare your app for GDPR compliance?</h2>
<p id="a6d0" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">GDPR is really serious about the privacy of app users and protects their rights thoroughly. This means that your app planning, development and management efforts must be revisited to make sure you comply with the guidelines laid out in the law. Though the privacy law hasn’t laid out a step-by-step process to follow, it has outlined some general rules while developing and publishing a mobile app.</p>
<p id="2318" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">According to this law, app publishers, developers and owners are now directly responsible for the security of personal user data. The term ‘personal data’ refers to any form of information that can be used to identify an individual including phone number, name, email address, username, location, insights, etc.</p>
<p id="8ea4" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">App owners must endeavor to be more transparent and provide more control to the users. This includes changing the way how data is acquired, stored, transferred and used currently. Everything must be done to enhance security and give users real-time access. At the same time, developers need to document the complete history of changes to personal data and encrypt transfers between the server and app mandatorily.</p>
<p id="cfb0" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">To make sure that as an app owner you offer complete control over their personal data, you need to adhere to the below mentioned guidelines in your app design:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="1204" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Relevance:<span> </span></strong>Identify if your app requires all the information you are requesting</li>
<li id="5fa5" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Consent:<span> </span></strong>Inform and obtain consent from the users to collect their private information</li>
<li id="6163" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Accountability:<span> </span></strong>Answer user queries regarding their private data usage and sharing</li>
<li id="78e3" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Security:<span> </span></strong>Encrypt private user data and secure your communication through HTTPS</li>
<li id="9603" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Transparency:<span> </span></strong>Keep users informed about data breaches and security loopholes</li>
<li id="a58f" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Portability:<span> </span></strong>Implement a protocol for data portability</li>
<li id="6c02" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Privacy:<span> </span></strong>Don’t track user activity and destroy cookies after user logs out</li>
<li id="19fc" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Disclosure:<span> </span></strong>Inform users about logs that capture location, IP address and data sharing with third parties</li>
<li id="5243" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Safety:<span> </span></strong>Store user logs in an encrypted manner</li>
<li id="101c" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Clarity:<span> </span></strong>Create understandable terms and conditions and ensure the user reads them completely</li>
<li id="7649" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hv ji">Erasure:<span> </span></strong>Delete personal data of the user if he/she opts out of the service</li>
</ul>
<p>Further take care of the below given points to keep your app GDPR compliant:</p>
<h3 id="ddc2" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Make an app based on privacy by design concept</strong></h3>
<p id="bd09" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">According to the<span> </span><a href="https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/23.htm" class="fc cf hp hq hr hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Article 23</a><span> </span>of the GDPR, Privacy by Design is now a legal requirement. Privacy by design is a development concept that makes an app developer, owner or publisher think of user privacy before starting the development process. Instead of leaving user privacy and data protection as an afterthought, your app development efforts should take steps to promote user privacy from the beginning, itself.</p>
<h3 id="e015" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Ask for user consent explicitly</strong></h3>
<p id="e692" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Every app or company must request a user to provide his/her consent to collect, use and transfer personal data. A user, while opting-in, must clearly understand the terms and conditions of personal data collection and usage.</p>
<p id="5ae5" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you are thinking of collecting user data in your mobile app, you must have an opt-in screen as soon as an app launches. The opt-in process should clearly give user the ability to provide consent to data collection, receive communication and should inform users about the places where data will be used.</p>
<p id="863f" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, if you are thinking of tracking user activity through Google Analytics, you are obligated to inform them about the same. At the same time, a user must be able to easily opt-out from future communications and request deletion of personal information. An app should have a dedicated page to give users the ability to opt-out to be completely GDPR-compliant.</p>
<h3 id="4104" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Promote transparency through an understandable privacy policy</strong></h3>
<p id="6906" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">To comply with GDPR completely, you need to inform users about your privacy policy. The policy should be documented in clear language without jargons so that a common user can understand the same. It should inform users about how you plan to manage and protect their personal data. Also, you will be required to disclose your source of data collection and processing if you are using a third-party solution.</p>
<p id="9766" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Your privacy policy should include all the level of assurances required for data protection and security laid down by the GDPR. At the same time, you need to make sure that the agreements you sign with your data processing partners have essential clauses that make user information is safe and protected at all times.</p>
<h3 id="5bb6" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Respond to user requests</strong></h3>
<p id="e30f" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Under GDPR, you are legally required to answer a user if he/she wants to know how you are using their personal data. To make your app compliant, you need to create a mechanism using which user can place a Subject Access Request. Once you receive such a request from any user, you are required to respond to it within one month. (For complicated requests, the period is three months)</p>
<p id="416b" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Developing an internal system to subject access requests is essential to stay compliant in the long term, failing which you would be breaking the privacy law, landing yourself in a legal trouble.</p>
<h3 id="f7be" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig"><strong class="hv ji">Review your third-party data processors</strong></h3>
<p id="7894" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you are using the services of any external data processor to analyze your app usage, you must disclose the fact explicitly.

<p id="191a" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Having a documented agreement with your data processor is a mandatory requirement to comply with GDPR. This means that you need to make sure that all third party and SDKs associated with your app are also required to be compliant with GDPR. As a data controller, it is your responsibility to ensure that all third parties are compliant and have efficient data security measures in place. In case of a security breach, you can be held accountable.</p>
<h3 id="b801" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Notify users of a data breach</strong></h3>
<p id="fab4" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">As a data controller, you are required to notify all the users and supervisory authorities of data breach if one occurs within 72 hours under the GDPR. In order to make this a reality, you might need to continuously monitor your data, identify risks and plug in loopholes. In case of a breach, you must have a clear policy to inform users and take necessary steps to protect their personal data.</p>
<h3 id="42ec" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Encrypt your stored data and external communications</strong></h3>
<p id="edb6" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">Every mobile app should essentially use SSL or HTTPS protocol for interaction with external players. Also, personal data sharing should always be encrypted. This means that when your mobile app interacts with your website or web servers to transfer personal data such as username or password, an SSL or HTTPS protocol must be in place.</p>
<p id="7001" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">To make sure that user data is secure at all times, the data should be stored securely at a safe place with appropriate encrypted backups. Users should be notified about the tenure of this storage explicitly to give them control over their personal information.</p>
<h3 id="ce5b" class="jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz"><strong class="bm">Create detailed logs of data collection activity</strong></h3>
<p id="e782" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">As per the<span> </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/" class="fc cf hp hq hr hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Article 30</a><span> </span>of the GDPR, every data controller i.e. an app owner or manager must keep a record of data processing activities. This means that you are required to have a detailed document of every single byte of data that you collect yourself through the mobile app or with the help of a third party. The data should be stored in the form of a secure and comprehensive log. The log should contain every detail including all the personal data collected including IP addresses, names, email addresses, etc.</p>
<p id="588f" class="ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig" data-selectable-paragraph="">After you collect this data, you should also justify it to the user that why are you collecting the data, where will you store and for how long will you store the data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p itemprop="description"><span>In late June, 2018, California passed a </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">consumer privacy act</a><span>, AB 375, that could have more repercussions on U.S. companies than the European Union’s </span><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3202771/data-protection/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-requirements-deadlines-and-facts.html">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a><span> that went into effect this past spring. The California law doesn&#8217;t have some of GDPR&#8217;s most onerous requirements, such as the narrow 72-hour window in which a company must report a breach. In other respects, however, it goes even farther.</span></p>
<p itemprop="description"><span>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) takes a broader view than the GDPR of what constitutes private data. The challenge for security, then, is to locate and secure that private data.</span></p>
<p itemprop="description">
<h2>What is the CCPA?</h2>
<p>AB 375 allows any California consumer to demand to see all the information a company has saved on them, as well as a full list of all the third parties that data is shared with. In addition, the California law allows consumers to sue companies if the privacy guidelines are violated, even if there is no breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which companies does the CCPA affect?</h2>
<p>All companies that serve California residents and have at least $25 million in annual revenue must comply with the law. In addition, companies of any size that have personal data on at least 50,000 people or that collect more than half of their revenues from the sale of personal data, also fall under the law. Companies don&#8217;t have to be based in California or have a physical presence there to fall under the law. They don&#8217;t even have to be based in the United States.</p>
<p>An amendment made in April exempts “insurance institutions, agents, and support organizations” as they are already subject to similar regulations under California’s Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act (IIPPA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When does my company need to comply with the CCPA?</h2>
<p>The law goes into effect on January 1, 2020. As a practical matter, companies need to have their data tracking systems in place by the start of 2019, since it gives consumers the right to request all the data a company has collected on them over the previous 12 months. That&#8217;s a very tight timeframe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What happens if my company is not in compliance with the CCPA?</h2>
<p>Companies have 30 days to comply with the law once regulators notify them of a violation. If the issue isn&#8217;t resolved, there&#8217;s a fine of up to $7,500 per record. &#8220;If you think about how many records are affected in a breach, it really increases very quickly,&#8221; says Debra Farber, senior director for privacy strategy at BigID. Since the bill was put together and passed in just a week, it will probably see some amendments, she adds. &#8220;Things like the fine amounts are likely to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another potential financial risk, Farber says. &#8220;The bill provides for an individual&#8217;s right to sue, for the first time &#8221; she says. &#8220;And it allows class action lawsuits for damages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, there&#8217;s a 30-day window that starts when the consumers give written notice to a company that they believe their privacy rights have been violated. &#8220;If it&#8217;s not cured, and the attorney general declines to prosecute, then they can bring a class action suit,&#8221; Farber says. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just around breaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, the law specifies that companies must have a clearly visible footer on websites offering consumers the option to opt out of data sharing. If that footer is missing, consumers can sue. They can also sue if they can&#8217;t find out how their information has been collected or get copies of that information. “It can be around anything,&#8221; Farber says.</p>
<p>The law assigns specific penalties should unauthorized access occur, whether through a breach, exfiltration, theft, or “disclosure as a result of the business’ violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices,” As currently written, AB 375 allows for penalties of $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater.</p>
<aside class="nativo-promo nativo-promo-2 tablet desktop smartphone"></aside>
<p>&#8220;Add in all the other breach related costs &#8212; IT response, forensics and recovery, legal, notification, and so on &#8212; and this could push a breach into the realm of an existential threat to many businesses,&#8221; says Chris Prevost, head of runtime security solutions architecture at Imperva.</p>
<p>In general, if a company took the steps needed to comply with the GDPR, then it&#8217;s most of the way there for the California Consumer Privacy Act. At least, it&#8217;s closer than if it isn&#8217;t ready for GDPR, says Eric Dieterich, data privacy practice leader at Focal Point Data Risk, LLC. &#8220;Some multinationals made changes for their European markets, but maybe didn&#8217;t roll it out to U.S.-based activities, so there might be a scoping change,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What data does the CCPA cover?</h2>
<p>The California law takes a broader approach to what constitutes sensitive data than the GDPR. For example, olfactory information is covered, as well as browsing history and records of a visitor&#8217;s interactions with a website or application. Here’s what AB 375 considers “personal information”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier IP address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers</li>
<li>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law</li>
<li>Commercial information including records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies</li>
<li>Biometric information</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with a website, application or advertisement</li>
<li>Geolocation data</li>
<li>Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar information</li>
<li>Professional or employment-related information</li>
<li>Education information, defined as information that is not publicly available personally identifiable information (PII) as defined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99)</li>
<li>Inferences drawn from any of the information identified in this subdivision to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, preferences, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities and aptitudes</li>
</ul>
<p>An amendment, AB 874, currently awaiting the governor&#8217;s signature would exempt publicly available, deidentified and aggregate consumer information from being classified as PII. Publicly available information is defined as data available and maintained from government records.</p>
<p>The CCPA originally covered employee as well as consumer data. An amendment passed in April, however, exempts employee data from the regulation. Another amendment, AB 25, partially exempts personal information collected from job applicants, owners, directors, officers, medical staff, and contractors. This exemption would expire on January 1, 2021. AB 25 was awaiting the governor&#8217;s signature at this writing.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What are the key privacy provisions in the CCPA?</h2>
<p>Companies must allow consumers to choose not to have their data shared with third parties. That means that companies will now have to be able to separate the data they collect according to the users&#8217; privacy choices.</p>
<p>In addition, while a company cannot refuse users equal service, it can offer incentives to users who provide personal information. &#8220;This provision might be subject to change, but as stated today, it gives you the ability to offer discounts to people who are willing to have their data shared or sold to third parties,&#8221; says Dieterich. &#8220;Traditionally, systems aren&#8217;t designed so that your pricing structure might change depending on your privacy choices. That&#8217;s a new concept that has very technical implications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another major difference with GDPR is that the California law allows customers much greater access to their records, says Subra Ramesh, SVP of products at Dataguise. A California consumer has the right to find out what information a company collects about them. Most companies are going to have trouble pulling that information together. &#8220;First, the amount of data they collect is already massive and continues to grow, often in the hundreds to thousands worth of terabytes, and with enterprise-level organizations processing petabytes of data,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>That data is contained in multiple storage platforms, in different file times. &#8220;Most file search tools lack the ability to search across the modern file repository ecosystems so prevalent today,” says Aaron Ganek, CEO of Cloudtenna.  “Cross-silo file management is a major challenge. It is difficult to understand context for each file if they are scattered inside different repositories.&#8221; Plus, compliance issues are associated with pulling together data, he says. &#8220;Legacy enterprise tools struggle to observe the disparate permissions and security models, violating the very laws and regulations they’re being used to satisfy.”</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the time limit. &#8220;After the access request, a company has 45 days to provide them a comprehensive report about what type of information they have, was it sold, and to whom, and if it was sold to third parties over the past 12 months, it must give the names and addresses of the third parties the data is sold to,&#8221; says John Tsopanis, privacy product manager at 1touch.io. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the rule covers the previous 12 months of records, companies have to start complying six months from now, he says. Then, on January 1, 2020, every company has to disclose every other company they sell data to. &#8220;It will change the privacy landscape in America forever,&#8221; Tsopanis says.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What does the CCPA mean for security?</h2>
<p>AB 375 is light on requirements around security and breach response when compared to the GDPR. As stated earlier, the law does define penalties for companies that expose consumer data due to a breach or security lapse. It also allows courts to offer “injunctive or declaratory relief,” or “any other relief the court deems proper.”</p>
<p>Businesses are not required to report breaches under AB 375, and consumers must file complaints before fines are possible. The best course of action for security, then, is to know what data AB 375 defines as private data and take steps to secrure it. Again, any organization that complies with the GDPR likely does not need to take further action to comply with AB 375 in terms of securing data.</p>
<p>The AB 375 requirements around tracking, accessing, and storing data mean security teams will need to work closely with database administrators, says Terry Ray, senior vice president and fellow at Imperva, a cybersecurity vendor. Any tools selected to help deal with AB 375 will not only need to have full visibility into data stored across the entire heterogenous corporate environment, but also ensure that access to this data is properly secured. &#8220;Lastly, they will need these tools to cooperate with the new consumer portal by sharing specific consumer data with the verifiable consumer requesting it,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>If the data is stored with cloud providers, the problem just gets worse. For example, employees might set up a file-sharing account to keep track of marketing or sales contacts. &#8220;It’s not surprising the large tech companies like Google and Facebook opposed the bill,&#8221; says Kevin Bocek, VP of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi. &#8220;Controlling the privacy and personal information that flows between machines is incredibly difficult, and a major challenge for all businesses.&#8221;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>A work in progress</h2>
<p>The bill was put together in just seven days because legislators wanted to avoid a ballot initiative to pass an even stricter law that was opposed by many tech companies. &#8220;Right now, many of the provisions and definitions conflict with one another,&#8221; says Andy Dale, general counsel and VP of global privacy at SessionM. &#8220;The law becomes effective in 2020, so expect amendments between now and implementation &#8212; but the core tenets and rights are likely to remain.&#8221;</p>
<p>One problematic area is whether a company can charge consumers different prices based on their privacy settings. For example, many companies have an option where a consumer can upgrade to a paid tier where they don&#8217;t see any ads. Here, the law as currently written is a little bit contradictory.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the consumer exercises his rights under the regulation, businesses cannot provide a different level or quality of product, goods or services to the consumer,&#8221; says Pravin Kothari, CEO of CipherCloud. &#8220;On the other side of the coin, according to the regulation, businesses are not prohibited from charging a consumer a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data.&#8221;</p>
<p>It looks like California is trying to define a framework where consumers can get paid for sharing their data, Kothari says. &#8220;In this area the legislation is a bit visionary,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see in practice how this actually works out.&#8221;</p>
