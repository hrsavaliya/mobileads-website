Even if it\u2019s a web application or mobile application, if your visitors are not getting a good user experience, then there will be chances of losing all your traffic soon.<\/p>\n<p>But maintaining the consistency with UI\/UX trends is not that easy as it seems to be.\u00a0As you can see, the software industry is growing with time by developing new products, technologies, and services. This is happening as customer&#8217;s needs and capabilities are continuously evolving.<\/p>\n<p>Here, we will discuss some of the UI\/UX trends that are going to dominate 2020. If you haven\u2019t started following these trends, then you might be left behind in the race.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Personalization:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Users are inclined to have a more personal touch, niche services that target the user&#8217;s interests. Develop a product based on the technical, social and cultural needs of the customer maintaining special and genuine user experience.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix, YouTube, and other similar apps, for example, give users versatile and personalized recommendations based on their background. Personalization drives a person towards content they are searching for and away from content that is meaningless to them in some way.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> 3D Models and Rendering:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It is not necessary that every new trend is fresh, as some of the trends take time to get in the limelight. And one such trend in 2020 is 3D Modelling and Rendering. Not that 3D modeling for apps\/websites were not available earlier; instead, it used to be highly expensive and unreachable to most of the web designers. And that why it was not used with the apps\/websites earlier.<\/p>\n<p>As technology develops, the cost of 3D modeling and rendering will drop down eventually and soon you will find many software tools in the market for the same.<\/p>\n<p>A few brands like Adidas have already initialized the use of 3D modeling and rendering on their websites. But there is one caveat. As the price drops, a lot of organizations will start implementing it. So you need to start working on it as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Voice User Interface:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some of the web and mobile applications are already following it, while others are still confused about whether they should use it or not. And whatever your business is, one thing is for sure that voice search is one of the most growing trends that will prevail in 2020. According to research, 41% of US adults already use voice commands on a regular basis, which can become more than 50% in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Voice user interface refers to the use of speech recognition or text to speech technology to help users interact with your web application via their voice. Some of the examples of the voice user interface include smart speakers like Alexa, which are now common in our daily life. Smart speakers have transformed our digital experience in a positive way in the last few years.<\/p>\n<p>The crucial advantage of using a voice user interface is that it completely excludes the need for a graphical user interface and complements your app with a new communication method while improving the user experience to a completely new level.<\/p>\n<p>Before following this trend blindly, make sure it is compatible with your app and meets all your user requirements. Generally, VUI is compatible with music apps, driving apps or various entertainment apps.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Artificial Intelligence:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence has already been in the software development industry for a long time now. Still, most businesses are nowhere near implementing it on their business app\/site.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two things to it, first, using AI as a technology to automate a few aspects of web design like performing automated cross-browser testing of web applications. Cloud-based tools like the Lambda test are making it easier for businesses to automate their cross-browser testing, real-time testing, parallel testing, etc.<\/p>\n<p>And the second thing, using AI as a contextual technology that makes your app\/site more human by interpreting user behavior and circumstances for allowing a tailored and personal experience. Therefore, it purely depends on businesses how they implement AI in their web design.<\/p>\n<p>There is one more technique in which AI is making its impact on the user \u2013 chatbots. These are used to provide 24\/7 support and assistance for visitors. You will find many apps\/sites that have implemented chatbots, but there is still a lack of emotional intelligence comparable to human support operatives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Dynamic User Experience:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All of us want a fascinating user experience when we visit any website or app. Many users prefer to multi-task while going through your app\/website, and others just want to access exactly what they are looking for. But, it is generally seen that most of the apps have multiple distractions on them, like the appearance of pop-ups consistently which distracts the user from unnecessary things. It is an important thing to notice while designing your web app or software product.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Google permits its users to access Google calendar while using Gmail at the same time. It partitions the screen in two parts so those users don\u2019t have to switch tabs. In 2020, we will see more Google products that provide a dynamic user experience.<\/p>\n<p>Your main focus should be on the user visiting your app. Consider what users are looking for instead of pushing things that you think the user might like.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Collecting User Data:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Collecting user data has never been an important factor for businesses as they never consider what users actually want from their app\/site. The user data was never utilized to form an app\/website. But in 2020, there will be new methods to utilize user data.<\/p>\n<p>Compiling user data and leveraging it with user permissions can shape the world of web design in 2020. Also, there will be more web designs based on user data in the coming years. If you do more functionality and interface testing to analyze what users respond to, and then implement that with your web design, you will be able to provide a better user experience to the visitors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> The Shift in UI Navigation:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We believe in 2020, the web designs with GUI will be more mobile optimized. For instance, the menu button for mobile apps will shift to the bottom of the screen so that it becomes thumb-friendly. In fact, not only the menu button but other buttons will also be moved to save as much screen space as possible for the valuable content.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the on-screen buttons will be replaced by gestures to make it simple for users to navigate. Though the use of gestural UI will be limited, as it could only be used for scrolling, swiping or tapping to interact with a web page. You might even see apps that use floating arrangements of pictures to reveal valuable information as visitors point their hands towards the screen.<\/p>\n<p>We have used smartphones and devices that use gestural UI for navigation, and we sure like that. So, chances are gestural UI for the web app is going to be one of the popular trends that will dominate 2020.<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to implement this user interface navigation to the app, make sure that the gestures are consistent across devices and comfortable for users. Usually, gestural-driven apps include tutorials or visual hints to help users understand the navigation process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> Animations or Micro-Interaction:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Micro-interactions or animations, both are comparably new premonitions that can take over the UI for web design in 2020. Micro-interactions are generally small design elements, but they can make a huge difference in your web design by creating the experience more humane for the audience. It doesn\u2019t mean you can use micro-interaction or animation on every web page. The best animations are those which are designed keeping user intent and interest in mind.<\/p>\n<p>So, when you are designing your app with micro-interactions or animations, keep one thing in mind- what you want your user to feel when they interact with the animations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about the author here &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluper.com\/?utm_source=Guest%20Blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=gb&amp;amp;utm_campaign=greedygame\">Fluper<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; User Interface and User Experience are the basis of software products.
