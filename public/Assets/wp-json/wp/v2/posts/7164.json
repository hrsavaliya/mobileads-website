To make this possible, the law has laid down four basic aspects that any app developer, data processor or website must respect. These aspects aim to provide:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"69e3\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Easy access to personal data:<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>Every user is entitled to know how their data is processed in a clear and understandable way.<\/li>\n<li id=\"99d1\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Right to data portability:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Users should be empowered to transfer their personal information from one service provider to another easily.<\/li>\n<li id=\"4165\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Right to be forgotten:<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>Users should have an option to delete their data by intimating their service provider through simple steps.

This means that your app planning, development and management efforts must be revisited to make sure you comply with the guidelines laid out in the law. Though the privacy law hasn\u2019t laid out a step-by-step process to follow, it has outlined some general rules while developing and publishing a mobile app.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2318\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">According to this law, app publishers, developers and owners are now directly responsible for the security of personal user data. The term \u2018personal data\u2019 refers to any form of information that can be used to identify an individual including phone number, name, email address, username, location, insights, etc.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8ea4\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">App owners must endeavor to be more transparent and provide more control to the users. This includes changing the way how data is acquired, stored, transferred and used currently. Everything must be done to enhance security and give users real-time access. At the same time, developers need to document the complete history of changes to personal data and encrypt transfers between the server and app mandatorily.<\/p>\n<p id=\"cfb0\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To make sure that as an app owner you offer complete control over their personal data, you need to adhere to the below mentioned guidelines in your app design:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li id=\"1204\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Relevance:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Identify if your app requires all the information you are requesting<\/li>\n<li id=\"5fa5\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Consent:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Inform and obtain consent from the users to collect their private information<\/li>\n<li id=\"6163\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Accountability:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Answer user queries regarding their private data usage and sharing<\/li>\n<li id=\"78e3\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Security:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Encrypt private user data and secure your communication through HTTPS<\/li>\n<li id=\"9603\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Transparency:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Keep users informed about data breaches and security loopholes<\/li>\n<li id=\"a58f\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Portability:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Implement a protocol for data portability<\/li>\n<li id=\"6c02\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Privacy:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Don\u2019t track user activity and destroy cookies after user logs out<\/li>\n<li id=\"19fc\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Disclosure:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Inform users about logs that capture location, IP address and data sharing with third parties<\/li>\n<li id=\"5243\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Safety:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Store user logs in an encrypted manner<\/li>\n<li id=\"101c\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Clarity:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Create understandable terms and conditions and ensure the user reads them completely<\/li>\n<li id=\"7649\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw jj hy jk ia jl ic jm ie jn ig jf jg jh\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Erasure:<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong>Delete personal data of the user if he\/she opts out of the service<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Further take care of the below given points to keep your app GDPR compliant:<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ddc2\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Make an app based on privacy by design concept<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"bd09\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">According to the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.privacy-regulation.eu\/en\/23.htm\" class=\"fc cf hp hq hr hs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Article 23<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>of the GDPR, Privacy by Design is now a legal requirement. Privacy by design is a development concept that makes an app developer, owner or publisher think of user privacy before starting the development process. Instead of leaving user privacy and data protection as an afterthought, your app development efforts should take steps to promote user privacy from the beginning, itself.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"e015\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Ask for user consent explicitly<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"e692\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Every app or company must request a user to provide his\/her consent to collect, use and transfer personal data. A user, while opting-in, must clearly understand the terms and conditions of personal data collection and usage.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5ae5\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you are thinking of collecting user data in your mobile app, you must have an opt-in screen as soon as an app launches. The opt-in process should clearly give user the ability to provide consent to data collection, receive communication and should inform users about the places where data will be used.<\/p>\n<p id=\"863f\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For example, if you are thinking of tracking user activity through Google Analytics, you are obligated to inform them about the same. At the same time, a user must be able to easily opt-out from future communications and request deletion of personal information. An app should have a dedicated page to give users the ability to opt-out to be completely GDPR-compliant.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"4104\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Promote transparency through an understandable privacy policy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"6906\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To comply with GDPR completely, you need to inform users about your privacy policy. The policy should be documented in clear language without jargons so that a common user can understand the same. It should inform users about how you plan to manage and protect their personal data. Also, you will be required to disclose your source of data collection and processing if you are using a third-party solution.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9766\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Your privacy policy should include all the level of assurances required for data protection and security laid down by the GDPR. At the same time, you need to make sure that the agreements you sign with your data processing partners have essential clauses that make user information is safe and protected at all times.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"5bb6\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Respond to user requests<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"e30f\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Under GDPR, you are legally required to answer a user if he\/she wants to know how you are using their personal data. To make your app compliant, you need to create a mechanism using which user can place a Subject Access Request. Once you receive such a request from any user, you are required to respond to it within one month. (For complicated requests, the period is three months)<\/p>\n<p id=\"416b\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Developing an internal system to subject access requests is essential to stay compliant in the long term, failing which you would be breaking the privacy law, landing yourself in a legal trouble.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"f7be\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\"><strong class=\"hv ji\">Review your third-party data processors<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"7894\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you are using the services of any external data processor to analyze your app usage, you must disclose the fact explicitly. You need to be transparent with the users about data transfer and processing and at the same time sign a detailed<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr\/accountability-and-governance\/contracts\/\" class=\"fc cf hp hq hr hs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">data processing agreement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"191a\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Having a documented agreement with your data processor is a mandatory requirement to comply with GDPR. This means that you need to make sure that all third party and SDKs associated with your app are also required to be compliant with GDPR. As a data controller, it is your responsibility to ensure that all third parties are compliant and have efficient data security measures in place. In case of a security breach, you can be held accountable.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"b801\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Notify users of a data breach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"fab4\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As a data controller, you are required to notify all the users and supervisory authorities of data breach if one occurs within 72 hours under the GDPR. In order to make this a reality, you might need to continuously monitor your data, identify risks and plug in loopholes. In case of a breach, you must have a clear policy to inform users and take necessary steps to protect their personal data.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"42ec\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Encrypt your stored data and external communications<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"edb6\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Every mobile app should essentially use SSL or HTTPS protocol for interaction with external players. Also, personal data sharing should always be encrypted. This means that when your mobile app interacts with your website or web servers to transfer personal data such as username or password, an SSL or HTTPS protocol must be in place.<\/p>\n<p id=\"7001\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To make sure that user data is secure at all times, the data should be stored securely at a safe place with appropriate encrypted backups. Users should be notified about the tenure of this storage explicitly to give them control over their personal information.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ce5b\" class=\"jo ii ds ba az ij jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\"><strong class=\"bm\">Create detailed logs of data collection activity<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p id=\"e782\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As per the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gdpr-info.eu\/art-30-gdpr\/\" class=\"fc cf hp hq hr hs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Article 30<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>of the GDPR, every data controller i.e. an app owner or manager must keep a record of data processing activities. This means that you are required to have a detailed document of every single byte of data that you collect yourself through the mobile app or with the help of a third party. The data should be stored in the form of a secure and comprehensive log. The log should contain every detail including all the personal data collected including IP addresses, names, email addresses, etc.<\/p>\n<p id=\"588f\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After you collect this data, you should also justify it to the user that why are you collecting the data, where will you store and for how long will you store the data.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"798b\" class=\"ih ii ds ba az ij du ik dw il im in io ip iq ir is\">That\u2019s not all!<\/h3>\n<p id=\"142e\" class=\"ht hu ds ba hv b hw iy hy iz ia ja ic jb ie jc ig\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Apart from the above steps, you might need to appoint a data protection officer if you are a public authority or if you require large scale monitoring, collection or processing of personal data.
