Our Services allow publishers of mobile applications (\u201capps\u201d) to show ads on their sites and apps, and advertisers to reach audiences that may be interested in their products or services. This Privacy Policy explains how GreedyGame collects and uses information about users of GreedyGame apps, publisher and advertiser customers that use the GreedyGame services, and end users of apps and sites that use the GreedyGame Services.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Section 1 describes how GreedyGame collects and uses information from end users in providing the GreedyGame Services; Section 2 describes how GreedyGame collects and uses information about GreedyGame Customers and the information GreedyGame collects when an individual uses the GreedyGame website; and Section 3 contains information about our privacy practices that apply to both the information we collect from end users through the GreedyGame Services and the information we collect from GreedyGame Customers and users of our website.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"font_8\"><strong>Section 1: End User Information<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"font_8\">The Information We Collect<\/h3>\n<p class=\"font_8\">When you interact with an app that uses the GreedyGame Services, we may collect information about your device and the ads you view or click. The GreedyGame Services are designed to avoid collecting information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, or email address, but the information we collect does enable us to recognize your device over time. The information we collect includes, but is not limited to:<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Information about your device, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS or Android), carrier name, IP address, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari), applications using the GreedyGame Services and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID, or unique device identifier (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer).Log information, including the app or website visited, session start\/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular), and cookie information.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">The geo-location of your device (using GPS or other geo-location data), when location services have been enabled for the mobile app or website that uses the GreedyGame Services.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser\u2019s website or purchased the product or service advertised.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Information that GreedyGame Customers and other third parties have collected and share with GreedyGame, such as information about activity in their services. This may include the content you view or searches you made, the language you prefer, or other non-personally identifying demographic or interest information, to help make the ads served to you more relevant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"font_8\">How We Use the Information We Collect<\/h3>\n<p class=\"font_8\">We use the information we collect to provide and improve GreedyGame Services, as well as to enable and allow for the improvement of related services provided by GreedyGame Customers or other third party partners in connection with the GreedyGame Services and across the broader advertising ecosystem, including for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Serving ads: Allowing publishers to offer advertising inventory in their mobile apps, and advertisers to bid on and fill that inventory.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Ad Reporting and Conversions: Reporting to advertisers information about when and how users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visit their website, and reporting to publishers information about when and how ads were shown on their properties and were clicked on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Frequency Capping: Preventing users from seeing the same ad too many times.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Fraud Detection and Prevention: Identifying invalid clicks (or ad queries) and protecting GreedyGame and GreedyGame Customers from fraudulent behaviour.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Interest-Based Advertising: Allowing GreedyGame and GreedyGame Customers to infer interests and serve ads to users based on their activity and inferred interests.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Geo-Targeting: Where permitted by the user\u2019s device, allowing GreedyGame and GreedyGame Customers to serve ads based on a user\u2019s location.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">Providing and Improving Our Services: Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to maintain, protect, and improve our Services and develop new services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">GreedyGame will not combine the non-personally identifiable information collected to provide the GreedyGame Services with your personally-identifying information without your express consent.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"font_8\">How We Share the Information We Collect<\/h3>\n<p class=\"font_8\">We share the information we collect to provide and improve GreedyGame Services, as well as to enable and allow for the improvement of related services provided by GreedyGame Customers or other third party partners in connection with the GreedyGame Services and across the broader advertising ecosystem, as follows:<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_8\">We share with advertiser customers information so that they can decide whether to bid on ad inventory or serve an advertisement and choose the best ad for that user on our mobile advertising exchange and across the broader advertising ecosystem.
